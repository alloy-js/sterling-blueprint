# Sterling

Sterling is a web-based visualization for Alloy, providing more customizable
visualizations than the built-in Alloy visualizer. Additionally, the Sterling
architecture is designed in a way that allows other model checking tools to
easily make use of its visualization capabilities.

## Setting up a development environment

To set up the Sterling development environment from scratch, run the following
commands

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alloy-js/sterling-ui.git

# Move in to the repository directory
cd sterling-ui

# Install all required libraries
npm install
```

To initiate a development environment using Sterling (the Alloy fork), you'll
need to start up Sterling *before* starting up the dev scripts.

Next, spin up the app in development mode by running

```bash
npm start
```

Note that if you do not have Sterling already running, you'll need to rerun
this script in order for

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
